            <div class="information">
                <p>Among various methods, a common and straightforward approach to current sensing is using a shunt resistor. In this method, a small resistor (milliohm range) called the shunt resistor is connected in series with the load and the supply. This allows the load current to flow through the shunt resistor as well. This will create a very small voltage difference across the shunt resistor. According to Ohmâ€™s law, the voltage drop across this shunt resistor is proportional to its current. Since this voltage difference is very small, a differential amplifier must be employed to amplify this to a readable value.</p>
